# VaadinCodeGenerator
This is a crud generator for vaadin using [viritin](https://github.com/viritin/viritin) for form handling. Its is Based
on [intellij-jpa-thymeleaf-scaffolder](https://github.com/petergeneric/intellij-jpa-thymeleaf-scaffolder). It is an intellij
 plugin so compile it as a plugin and install. You will find it under the generate menu. 
 You can access it by alt+insert from the jpa entity to want to generate the crud for. Once you click "Vaadin Crud" Enter the package where the jpa entity is and click ok.
 The plugin will generate all the Crud views in the same directory. The plugin is quite simple but I shall advance it
 further.
